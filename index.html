								<p>This is the website of the Forest Ecology Lab at the <a href="https://www.ips.unibe.ch/">Institute of Plant Sciences</a> of the University of Bern. 
								</p>
								
								<p>The Forest Ecology Lab started their first steps in September 2024, founded by Rubén D. Manzanedo, Assistant Professor at UniBe. </p>
								<p>
								The group studies how forest ecosystems respond to and are affected by environmental change acrosss temporal, spatial, and developmental scales. This remains one of the most 
								pressing challenges in comprehending the effects of climate change on forests worldwide. We work across scales: from local
								 to global, across ecosystems, and approaches. Repeated inventories, dendrochronological approaches, big open data, and citizen-science data are 
								 common tools that we use to try gaining unique perspectives and ecological insights that pushes the boundary of forest ecology. 
								</p>
								<p>We are a group of ecologists and foresters from a diversity of backgrounds and cultures, who celebrate and embrace diversity in all its forms. </p>								
								Current projects of the group center in the use of big tree-ring data to assess long-term responses of forest to environmental change, 
								assessing and improving long-term data quality for open databases globally, and investigating changes in environmental requirements across tree development. <br />

								further degrades.</p>
